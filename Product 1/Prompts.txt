1. Industrial Chic Bathroom:  A modern, minimalist bathroom. A large, industrial-style mirror.  leek chrome fixtures and high-powered lighting complete the professional look.

2. Barber Shop with a Modern Twist:  A high-end barber shop with sleek black leather barber chairs and chrome accents. A tattooed barber with a confident expression shaves a client who is applying shaving cream. Geometric tile floors and strategically placed spotlights create a modern and professional atmosphere.

3. A shelf filled with men's grooming products: This could include a razor, shaving brush, aftershave lotion, and a styling product for hair.

4. A rustic wooden table with a white towel folded neatly in the background: This would create a clean and professional look, while still being visually interesting.

5. A brightly lit bathroom with a white lavish marble in the background: This is a classic setting for shaving products and would immediately communicate the product's use.
